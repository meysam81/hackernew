### Full Description (Maker's Comment)

```
Hey Product Hunt!

We use Hacker News every day. It's genuinely one of the best corners of the internet—the discussions, the community, the signal-to-noise ratio. We love it.

HackerNew started as a simple question: "What if HN was built with a modern 2025 stack?" Not to replace it or criticize it, but to explore and learn.

Here's what we built:

🎨 **Modern, minimal design** — Inspired by tools like Linear, Vercel, and Raycast. Clean typography, thoughtful spacing, and a focus on content.

🌙 **Dark mode** — Follows your system preference, or toggle manually. Easy on the eyes at 2am (we've all been there).

⌨️ **Keyboard-first** — Vim-style navigation: j/k to move, o to open links, c for comments, b to bookmark. Power users, this one's for you.

📚 **Bookmarks & history** — Save stories for later. Track what you've read. Syncs across devices if you want (optional Supabase auth).

⚡ **Fast** — Static site generation with Astro's island architecture. Minimal JavaScript. Pages load in milliseconds.

🔓 **Open source** — Apache 2.0 licensed. Fork it, learn from it, deploy your own instance.

**The stack:**
- Astro 4 for static generation
- Vue 3 for interactive components
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Supabase for auth (optional)
- Bun for blazing fast builds

This is a learning project and a tribute to the HN community. We're not trying to replace anything—just exploring what's possible and sharing the result.

Would love to hear what you think! What features would you add? What would you do differently?

## Responses to Common Questions

### "Why not just use the official HN site?"

```
Great question! You absolutely should—we use it every day. HackerNew isn't meant to replace HN. It's a learning project and design exploration. We wanted to see what it would feel like to build HN with modern tools, and share what we learned along the way.
```

### "What makes this different from other HN clients?"

```
A few things:

1. It's a web app, not a native app—works everywhere
2. Fully open source with a permissive license
3. Built with modern tools (Astro, Vue 3, Tailwind v4) so others can learn from the code
4. Keyboard-first navigation (vim-style)
5. Optional auth—works great without any account

But honestly, use whatever works for you!
```

### "Will you add [feature]?"

```
Maybe! We're keeping the scope intentional—we don't want to add features just because we can. But we're definitely open to ideas that would genuinely improve the reading experience.

Feel free to open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/meysam81/hackernew/issues
```

### "Is this affiliated with Y Combinator or Hacker News?"

```
No, this is an independent open source project. We use the official, public HN API. HackerNew is a fan project—a love letter to the community we enjoy being part of.
