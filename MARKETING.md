## Notes

- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on Tier 1 platforms first
- **Engage authentically**: Don't just drop links - tell stories, respond to feedback
- **Timing matters**: Coordinate launches, avoid weekends
- **Iterate**: Use feedback from early platforms to improve before broader launch
- **Be patient**: Building awareness takes time - this is a marathon, not a sprint
